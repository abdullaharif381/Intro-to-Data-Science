## Introduction:

1. **Problem statement**:<br> The value of a used car depends on various factors such as its age, mileage and features. However, there are not enough reliable and transparent ways to estimate the fair price of a used car in Pakistan. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the value of a used car based on its attributes. The model will help buyers and sellers to negotiate better deals and avoid frauds.<br></t>
<br>
2. **Source of the dataset**:<br> The dataset was uploaded by Muhammad Waqar Gul on Kaggle, a platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts, on October 2022.<br><br>

3. **Brief description about the dataset**: <br>The dataset contains information about used cars in Pakistan, such as the model year, location, engine type, fuel type, transmission, engine capacity, mileage, and features of the cars.
- Total rows = 89,955
- Total columns = 16
<br>
